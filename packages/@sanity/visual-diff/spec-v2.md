# Specification draft: Visual diff

## Using the Visual Diff in a Studio

In Studio context, a developer can import a component (e.g. `<VisualDiff>`) which takes two versions of a document as props and renders a complete diff.

The `<VisualDiff>` component does three things:

  1. Resolves all `summarizers` and `visualizers` which are available in the Studio context, both from Sanity defaults, from the current Studio and from third-party plugins
  2. Calls a function (currently located in `bateson.js`) which, based on the summarizers and the two document versions, creates a list of `change summaries` which describe the differences between the two documents. See "The Change Summary" below for more details.
  3. Renders a component which takes the change summaries and visualizers (and probably the two document versions) and produces a nice, humanly understandable, description of all the changes.

It should be possible to pass styling and other useful UI options to the <VisualDiff> component.


## The Change Summary

Let's say a `zoo` document has changed the value on key `keeper.age` from `7` to `8`. This diff would produce the following `change summary`:

### An example

```
{
  "operation": "edit",
  "path": [
    "keeper",
    "age"
  ],
  "field": "age",
  "from": 7,
  "to": 8
}
```

### Change Summary properties

A quick breakdown of the change summary properties:

- `operation` - Describes what type of change has occured. There are four standard kinds:
  - `edit` - A value has changed
  - `add` - A value has appeared where there was none
  - `remove` - A value has been removed
  - `replace` - The object type has changed
- `path` - An array of strings which when put together denotes the absolute path to a point in the JSON data structure where the change has occured. A `string` entry in this array signifies that an object or a primitive has changed. An `object` entry signifies that an array has been changed (the `_key: 'abc123'` key refers to which object, see example below)
- `field` - The name of the Sanity schema field where the change has occurred
- `from` - The old value
- `to` - The new value


### Some more examples

If the `zoo.location` had been set (where there previously was no value) this is what the change summary would look like:

```
{
  "operation": "add",
  "path": [
    "location"
  ],
  "field": "location",
  "to": {
    "_type": "geopoint",
    "lat": 58.63169011423141,
    "lng": 9.089101352587932,
    "alt": 13.37
  }
}
```

If the `zoo.primates` array has a new member:

```
{
  "operation": "add",
  "path": [
    "primates",
    {"_key": "abc123"}
  ],
  "field": "primates",
  "to": {
    "_type": "primate",
    "_key": "abc123",
    "name": "Bob",
    "species": "Nomascus concolor",
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `path` array contains `{"_key": "abc123"}` which refers to the added element


## Custom Summarizers

`Summarizers` produce `change summaries`. A summarizer's task is to describe a distinct change which has happened between the two documents. A summarizer is defined per schema type, and returns a function which returns an array of one or more change summaries. A developer can implement a `part:@sanity/visual-diff/summarizers` to define her own custom Summarizers. E.g.:

```
const summarizers = {
  string: {
    resolve: (a, b, path) => {
      return {
        fields: [],
        changes: [
          {
            operation: 'editText',
            from: a,
            to: b
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },

  image: {
    resolve: (a, b, path) => {
      const changes = []
      if (!a.asset && b.asset) {
        changes.push({operation: 'addImage', to: b.asset._ref})
      } else if (a.asset && !b.asset) {
        changes.push({operation: 'removeImage', from: a.asset._ref})
      } else if (a.asset && b.asset && a.asset._ref !== b.asset._ref) {
        changes.push({operation: 'replaceImage', from: a.asset._ref, to: b.asset._ref})
      }
      return changes.length ? {fields: ['asset'], changes} : null
    }
  }
}

export default summarizers
```

The `resolve` function of a summarizer takes the parameters...
  - `a` - Original value
  - `b` - Modified value
  - `path` - An array of strings which when put together denotes the absolute path of where the change has occured (see the `path` array on change summary above)

...and returns an object with two keys:
- `fields` - An array of strings which names the fields this custom summarizer has handled. An empty array means "I've handle all fields" on this object. A `null` or `undefined` value means it has handled no fields. The internal diff logic will take responsibility for handling any _other_ fields not mentioned in this array.
- `changes` - An array of changes summaries (see above). These need not contain the `path` and `type` fields, as they will be automatically added by the internal diff logic.


**Note**: The image summarizer in the example above returns `{fields: ['asset'], changes}`. This means the custom summarizer has handled the `asset` field, but any other fields on the same image object (e.g. `caption`) has not been handled.

If there are multiple summarizers defined for the same type, the last one wins. "Last" in this sense means the one defined latest in the `parts` array in the Studio's `sanity.json` file.

Thus, defining a summarizer for type `a` will supersede any other summarizers for type `a`, but won't affect the presence of a summarizer for type `b` defined elsewhere.


### Custom Visualizers

A developer can implement `part:@sanity/visual-diff/visualizers` to define custom `visualizers`. A Visualizer is defined per type _and_ operation. It's output is a user-friendly rendering of a particular change. An example could look like:

```
string: {
  editText: {
    component: props => {
      const {op: operation, field, from, to} = props.item
      return (
        <div>{field} [{operation}] "{from}" --> "{to}"</div>
      )
    }
  }
}
```

Defining a custom visualizers will override any default visualizers for the same type _and_ operation. Defining a visualizer for type `image.replaceImage` won't affect the presence of a visualizer `image.addImage` defined elsewhere.


## There will be UI affordances to revert individual changes

Each change summary provides enough information to generate a "revert patch". A button in the UI will enable a Studio user to apply that patch.

If a developer has implemented a custom summarizer, we may be unable to assemble the correct revert patch. It is a developers responsibility to:
  - Either: Ensure that the change summary is understandable by our logic (i.e. follows the above contract)
  - Or: The change summary includes it's own `revert` key wherein there's enough information to assemble a revert patch. E.g.:

```
{
  "operation": "replaceImage",
  "field": "mainImage",
  "from": "image-ref-123",
  "to": "image-ref-456",
  "revert": {
    "operation": "edit",
    "path": ["mainImage", "asset", "_ref"],
    "from": "image-ref-123",
    "to": "image-ref-456"
  }
}
```


## There will be a "blame" feature, which renders the username responsible along side each change

Hook up Mendoza to enable this üêâ

## There should be excellent docs on how to create custom summarizers/visualizers

`!important`

## TODO

- Reverting
  - If notrevert function is defined for a type, use default revert based on path
- Gracfully handle data which doesn't match the current schema? E.g. docA has a different (typically unmigrated data) structure than docB
- Should we support that a summarizer can return `fields: ['key.deeperKey']`?
- Make bateson apply `path` and `field` key to all change summaries after being produced by the summarizer
- On startup, when resolving all implemented summarizers and visualizers, console.log if there are overlapping implementations
- Visualizer should nest through the schema, and for each type check if there is a change summary for that particular field to be rendered
